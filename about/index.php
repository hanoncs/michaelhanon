                <p>Currently i'm working as a programmer/developer at a small company specializing in retail, living out
                    here in Silicon Valley.
                    I'm a pretty typical tech dude. I love blogging, coding, building drones, and spending time with my
                    beautiful wife and kids.
                    She recently gave us our second bundle of joy.</p>

                <p>I started this blog as a way to get some of my ideas out there and to help any future googlers
                    looking for to solve the same problems I've already come across.</p>

                <p>If you're in the industry you may have noticed that this is a bootstrap site. Yes, I admit it, I used
                    bootstrap. ðŸ™Š
                    Now, for the reasoning, I used bootstrap for two main reasons. The first reason was to get this up
                    and running quickly. And the second reason is that i'm not a designer. Personally i'm not a bootstrap hater, but I know in the industry
                    some look down on bootstrap users.</p>

                <p>Hopefully you'll find something useful here, and i'm always reachable using the contact page.</p>
